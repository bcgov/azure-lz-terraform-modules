# Azure Logic App

This code was developed to create a Logic App that will be used to process Alerts from Azure Monitor (which are created by the Azure Monitor Baseline Alerts (AMBA) implementation), from the Platform part of the environment. This is not used for the Landing Zones.

This Logic App also integrates with Jira Service Management (JSM) to create a ticket for the alert.
